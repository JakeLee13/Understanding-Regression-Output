# Understanding-Regression-Output
How to extract information from an OLS MLR model output.

The goal of this notebook is to understand each piece of a regression output. We will go through each ouput from an example OLS MLR model from housing data. 

In order, we will cover:
 - R-squared
 - Adjusted R-squared
 - Degrees of Freedom
 - F statistic
 - Probability of the F statistic
 - Constant Coefficient
 - Beta Coefficients
 - Standard Error
 - t-value
 - p-value
 - Confidence Intervals
